# EI_Coding_Tansy
Overview
This repository demonstrates creative coding exercises for two main tasks:

Exercise 1 – Design Patterns: Implement six creative use cases covering behavioural, creational, and structural design patterns.

Exercise 2 – Mini Projects: Develop simple console-based mini-projects to demonstrate practical programming logic.

All programs are console-based, focus on logic and code quality, and include exception handling and comments to explain functionality.

Exercise 1 – Design Patterns

Objective:
Understand and implement software design patterns in creative scenarios.

Requirements:
Two use cases for behavioural patterns

Two use cases for creational patterns

Two use cases for structural patterns

Example Creative Implementations:
*Behavioural	  
DynamicPotion	           Chain of Responsibility pattern to handle different potion effects dynamically.
RestaurantOrderSystem	   Command pattern to manage and execute restaurant customer orders.
*Creational	  
SmartHomeFactory	       Abstract Factory pattern to create different smart home devices.
GameSettings             Singleton	Singleton pattern to manage global game settings.
*Structural	  
TimeTravel	             Adapter pattern to convert ancient date formats for a time machine system.
AR	                     Bridge pattern to separate abstraction and implementation in an augmented reality system.

Features:
* Proper exception handling for invalid inputs.
* Code comments explaining logic and pattern usage.
* Simple console-based implementation for clarity.

Exercise 2 – Mini Projects

Objective:
Develop small console-based project to practice programming logic, modularity, and exception handling.

Project	Description
Astronaut Daily Schedule Organizer	Manage daily tasks with priorities, add/remove/view tasks.

Features:
* Focus on logic over UI
* Proper code comments and exception handling
* Console-based applications for simplicity
